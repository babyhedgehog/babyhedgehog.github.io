They wanted to create the backend and frontend of a global community to connect experts and entrepreneurs with a passion for solving humanity's grand challenges. I've participated in this project as a React Native developer.

- Single Sign-On
I've integrated the authentication with **AuthO** to provide a seamless experience to users through multiple apps with just one set of credentials.

- In-app chat
To connect users within the global community, I integrated with **Sendbird** to offer a full-featured modern messenger built in the apps, providing both 1on1 and group chat.

- Scalable search
Once the number of users increased, we scaled the search feature using **Elasticsearch**, allowing users to quickly find relevant data in the community such as news, people, and events nearby.
