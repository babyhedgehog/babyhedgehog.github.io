As an experienced React developer, I've participated in Collecteurs project. I've worked on transitioning the website to React giving it a nice and snappy feel, substantially increasing site speed and we've implemented a top of the line user interface. As for the design, we gave it a more unusual monochromatic aesthetic with a half fixed, half scrollable layout, a generous featured article area and a lot of visible metrics, with heavy social media interaction. Being a crowdfunded project, Collecteurs has seen a large amount of media coverage, from The New York Times to more niche publications like Artuner.

The web application that is going to change the way we see art!
