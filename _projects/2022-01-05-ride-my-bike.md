Sodexo is a global food services and facilities management company with over 428,237 employees working across 80 different countries. Fleet and fuen management is a key part of Sodexo's service, delivered to market via Wizeo: Sodexo's platform for effective, real-time management of fleets and fuel.

Sodexo wanted to create a new mobile experience for the Wizeo app using React Native. I've participated in this project as a React Native developer.

A new design had been created to transform the user experience and the business was counting on a software development partner to deliver on the vision. If they could get the Wizeo app right, it had the potential to be rolled out to several other regions across the world to offer effective fleet and fuel management throughout Sodexo's network.
