The objectives were to redesign the existing website and make the customer experience one to remember, improve the UI, and add features that enhance accessibility. I've participated in this project as a JavaScript developer.

Using the versatility of Apollo, GraphQL and React, with the power of Microsoft's TypeScript, we gave the business a modern spin focusing primarily on client experience. In this regard we added several new features such as an Integrated Search with Algolia, a Shop Experience with React and several WordPress plugins for the customer pages. When it comes to aesthetics we chose to focus on a premium look with a clean UI, focusing primarily on customer experience, partnerships and news about the business. On the products page we implemented an intuitive side menu with category selection.
