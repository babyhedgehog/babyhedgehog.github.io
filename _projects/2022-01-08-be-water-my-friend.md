Leverage is software to help financial intermediaries earn referral and repeat business by increasing the certainty of execution for debt and equity placements. At its core, it's a tool to organize and automate the due diligence stage that occurs between a signed letter of internt (LOI) and closing. By streamlining workflow and easing collaboration, our clients are better able to serve their clients.

The objective was to design an app that gives oversight to the due diligence stage, effectively helping clients close deals and minimizing human error with 24/7 oversight and firm transparency.

Though given a simple set of criteria, our work with Leverage was very dear to us, in that it was a smooth, well-planned journey. We used Meteor and React with GraphQL to create a simple interface with an intuitive scroll design, and a generous amount of space for plenty of explanations. The dual color aesthetic of the website was made with consideration for their brand identity guidelines, while also taking into account the readability and easy access to information.
