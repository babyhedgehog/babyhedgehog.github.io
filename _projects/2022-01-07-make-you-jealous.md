Tapcart is a game-changing SaaS platform that allows Shopify merchants to create launch, and manage mobile shopping apps with no coding required.

After launching more than 300 iOS apps in less than one year, Tapcart entered into a high-growth mode and was ready to expand on to Android. The Android version needed to fulfill the high expectations set by the iOS version with immediate usage for its customers.

I've participated in this project as an Android developer. Tapcart already had a strong in-house iOS development team located in Santa Monica, California. Our team agreed on the best workflow to ensure both teams would work together effectively, and we continually reviewed their technical documentation and iOS Codebase.

To build a native Android app with a delightful look and feel, I adapted core elements of the app to adhere to Android design principles and best practices. I defined a modular Android app architecture, following the most recent Google guidelines, to ensure the app would scale along the journey to pair the successful iOS app.

The app architecture also foresaw a white-label structure to launch custom native apps for different brands from the same codebase.
